# --- Thin-reference-list enrichment ------------------------------------
#
# Many toolkits' "list" actions return bare references (IDs) rather than
# content — e.g. HACKERNEWS_GET_TOP_STORIES returns up to 500 integer
# story_ids, and its own output schema says outright: "Use these IDs with
# the get_item_with_id action to retrieve full story details." A blueprint
# step built around one such action hands a downstream ai_generate step
# (or any {{step_N_result}} reference) a list of numbers with nothing to
# summarize — the model then either correctly refuses or hallucinates.
#
# This is not a Hacker News problem specifically: the same "list returns
# references, a sibling action resolves one reference into full content"
# shape recurs across many REST-ish APIs Composio wraps. Rather than
# hardcode per-app fixes, detect the SHAPE generically and resolve the
# matching detail action within the same toolkit — via Composio's own
# schema-hint text first (free), falling back to the same AI-assisted
# action-disambiguation `_resolve_action_slug` already uses elsewhere in
# this file. Every step here is deliberately conservative and fails open:
# any ambiguity, missing data, or error just leaves the original result
# untouched — this must never turn a working call into a broken one.
